QTIDE (pronounced "Q" "TIDE") is the core drag and drop functionality for the QIDE editor. UI tweaks have taken up much of my time that is better spent on the core.

As a developer, create programs by dragging and dropping the language's objects (such as classes, variables, functions) onto the canvas.

Behind the scenes, code is autogenerated to quickly produce results.
