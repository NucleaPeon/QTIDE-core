QTIDE-core
==========

QTIDE (pronounced "Q - tide") is the core drag and drop functionality for the QIDE editor I am currently working on. Essentially it is a component of a large project that is also standalone.

==========

As a developer, you can create programs by dragging and dropping the language's objects (such as classes, variables, functions) onto the canvas.

Behind the scenes, code is autogenerated to quickly produce results.
